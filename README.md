# EcoFootprint Calculator

# Overview
 
The EcoFootprint Calculator is a web-based application aimed at promoting environmental awareness by calculating users' personal carbon footprints based on their daily routines, dietary habits, and travel patterns. It provides actionable insights and recommendations for individuals to reduce their environmental impact, supported by a database that tracks user inputs and suggested eco-friendly practices.
 
## Key Functionalities
- **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** Users input data related to their lifestyle, such as energy consumption, transportation methods, dietary preferences, and travel habits. The system then calculates the carbon footprint and provides a detailed breakdown of emissions sources.
 
- **Eco-Friendly Suggestions:** Based on the calculated footprint, the system offers personalized recommendations for reducing environmental impact, such as alternative transportation methods, energy-saving tips, and sustainable dietary changes.
 
- **Progress Tracking:** Users can set goals and track their progress over time, with the system offering feedback and adjusting recommendations based on achieved reductions in carbon footprint. This feature motivates continued engagement and improvement.
 
- **Educational Resources:** The platform includes articles, videos, and tips on sustainability, providing users with the knowledge and tools needed to make informed decisions about reducing their environmental impact.
 
## Implementation Details

- **Front-end Development:** The application will be built with HTML, CSS (using a framework like Materialize for a modern look), and JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience.
 
- **Back-end Development:** PHP will manage server-side logic and database interactions, with a MySQL database storing user profiles, footprint calculations, and recommendations.
 
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** JavaScript libraries (e.g., Chart.js) will be used to visualize carbon footprint data and progress over time, enhancing user comprehension and engagement.
 
- **Security and Validation:** Input validation using JavaScript and PHP will safeguard against malicious data, ensuring the integrity and security of user inputs and system outputs.
